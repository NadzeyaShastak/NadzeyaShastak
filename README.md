## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'am Nadzeya Shastak 

I'm a âœ¨ **data scientist** âœ¨ from Belarus)
I currently live in Mersin, Turkey. 

After nearly 10 years as a coating engineer, I transitioned into data science because Iâ€™m truly fascinated by algorithms and their power to uncover insights. 
Iâ€™m passionate about working with dataâ€”solving challenges like handling messy datasets, tuning parameters, understanding which algorithms perform best and why, and ultimately delivering insights that help businesses make smarter decisions.

The world is changing rapidlyâš¡, and I strive to stay up to date ðŸ˜„. 
Iâ€™ve completed my studies at Eduson Academy, which laid a strong foundation for me, but I know thereâ€™s much more to learn ðŸŒ±. Iâ€™m now focused on deepening my skills in deep learning, neural networks, and advanced data science techniques. 
Iâ€™m excited about this journey and look forward to tackling new challenges while contributing to impactful projects.

Iâ€™m eager to collaborate ðŸ‘¯ with like-minded data scientists who share my excitement for algorithms, feature engineering, and solving problems in unique, unconventional ways.

Letâ€™s connect, learn, work and solve extraordinary challenges together!
